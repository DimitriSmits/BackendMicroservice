# Getting started
- Starting LocalStack SQS Queue -> [link to docs](./docs/get-started-localstack.md)
- Using Docker to start PowerUsage -> [link to docs](./docs/get-started-docker-development.md)

*Note: LocalStack needs to run and have queues.<br> This way PowerUsage can connect to local sqs queues
